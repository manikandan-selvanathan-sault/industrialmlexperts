    content: "> _Our vision is to train the industrial and HVAC machines to learn to troubleshoot themselves and also educate the technicians in an effective and fun way._\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is no doubt that every technician will understand the functionality of machines and parts by using this service. Also, they can visualize the reality in all angles. For more complicated machine parts they will get to learn quickly with 3D model representations with interactive explanations. This app provides a fun approach to learning. This makes learning interesting. As a result, it gives a pretty positive impact on the technicians and keeps them engaged.\r\n\n\r\n\nThe primary challenge of this service would be numerous amounts of parts and machines in different firms around the world. Collecting information and common problems would be difficult for different machines. But in another three years, planning to cover 60 percent of the most commonly used products and the next two years will be trying to complete above 90 percent of all the units.\r\n\n\r\n\nAs we already know various amounts of common problems and the solutions, we can use those experiences to train the machine learning model and that will help the machine to fix the problems by itself. We can improvise this model in the future by adding more and more issues and problems to become very effective.\r\n\n\r\n\nThe future dreams of this product would make agreements with almost all the manufacturers and use the service to enhance productivity by eliminating manual efforts and errors."
