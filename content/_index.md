          As we already know various amounts of common problems and the
          solutions, we can use those experiences to train the machine learning
          model and that will help the machine to fix the problems by itself. We
          can improvise this model in the future by adding more and more issues
          and problems to become very effective.

          The services which we provide are distinct from other competitorsâ€™
          services and mainly it reduces cost. Other competitive service
          providers are using Virtual Reality (VR). It needs an additional
          device to view the parts virtually and it costs between 100$ and 600$
          and also technicians must not carry the VR device wherever they want
          to go.

          Technicians can access this anywhere and anytime using their mobile
          phones. For instance, they can get the machine to server communication
          logs and possible solutions. This is a good way to replace paper books
          and manual training.
