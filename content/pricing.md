Collecting information and common problems of machines would be difficult for different machines.\r\n2. Funding for the initial development of the app is crucial. As it involves all the modules must be ready to develop a simple application.\r\n\nOverall, we will try to mitigate the risk instead of accepting it by prompt action to the opinions of customers.\n\n**Technology risk:**\r\n\n**Platforms:**\r\n\n* To reach all the customers, we have to develop mobile apps for all platforms. Some customers also use browsers to troubleshoot the problems. So, we must develop apps on both mobile and web platforms.\r\n\n**Tools:**\r\n\n* Finding the best tool to design and develop augmented reality will be difficult. Since the core functionality of the app depends on this tool might be a huge risk.\r\n\n**Accuracy and reach:**\r\n\n* **Machine learning:**\r\n  * Machine learning takes time to optimize the accurate models.\r\n* **Augmented Reality:**\r\n  * Various manufacturing companies will be having multiple parts and units. It will be difficult to design the AR model for all of them.\r\n\n\n\n![]()\n\n****\n\n**Market:**\r\n\n* In the existing market, few Competitive companies have built a very good base for training. So, in the training service, it will take some time to reach customers initially.\r\n* Machine Learning and augmented reality are emerging now, but there are uncertainties about these technologies for the upcoming years. So, there is a risk involved in the first year of this service.\r\n\n\n\n![]()\n\n**Manage Risk:**\r\n\n* For developing machine learning and augmented reality modules, There is a plan to make a contract to a third party for development with the existing team. So we must transfer the risk to those third vendors.\r\n* We must take serious ways to data protection, and give good customer service which keeps customers feeling valued in the long term. This way we can mitigate the follower risk in the market.\r\n* The most effective way to build our business is to build strategic alliances with other competitor businesses that target the same market. \r\n\n![]()\n\n**Financial:**\r\n\n* Since we have to develop both mobile and web apps, it involves more resources and requires a good amount of funds. And also as the number of parts and units increases, we have to develop the AR model for all of them. It raises the chances of getting into Credit risk.\r\n* Getting enough investors will be quite a challenging task.      \r\n* Paying interest increases financial risks which decreases overall return on investment.\r\n  ![](/images/finance.jpg)\n\n**Team:**\r\n\n* Since it is a new technology, finding relevant experienced people in this domain will be difficult. \r\n* It is easy to get mobile app developers but designers for augmented reality would be a tough task. \r\n* There are only a few machine learning experts in the market now.\r\n* This service needs a lot of believe and patients as it is a new venture. Finding people with similar beliefs, dedication and trustworthy will not be an easy task. Every individual will have different thoughts and goals.\r\n\n\n\n![]()"
