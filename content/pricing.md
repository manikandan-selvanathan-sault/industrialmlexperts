      **The major risks of this service follows**


      1. There are a numerous amount of parts and machines in different firms
      around the world. Collecting information and common problems of machines
      would be difficult for different machines.

      2. Funding for the initial development of the app is crucial. As it
      involves all the modules must be ready to develop a simple application.


      Overall, we will try to mitigate the risk instead of accepting it by

          **Platforms:**


          * To reach all the customers, we have to develop mobile apps for all
          platforms. Some customers also use browsers to troubleshoot the
          problems. So, we must develop apps on both mobile and web platforms.


          **Tools:**


          * Finding the best tool to design and develop augmented reality will
          be difficult. Since the core functionality of the app depends on this
          tool might be a huge risk.




          **Accuracy and reach:**


          * **Machine learning:**
            * Machine learning takes time to optimize the accurate models.
          * **Augmented Reality:**
            * Various manufacturing companies will be having multiple parts and units. It will be difficult to design the AR model for all of them.

      - details: >-
          * In the existing market, few Competitive companies have built a very
          good base for training. So, in the training service, it will take some
          time to reach customers initially.

          * Machine Learning and augmented reality are emerging now, but there
          are uncertainties about these technologies for the upcoming years. So,
          there is a risk involved in the first year of this service.

          * Since we have to develop both mobile and web apps, it involves more
          resources and requires a good amount of funds. And also as the number
          of parts and units increases, we have to develop the AR model for all
          of them. It raises the chances of getting into Credit risk.

          * Getting enough investors will be quite a challenging task.      

          * Paying interest increases financial risks which decreases overall
          return on investment.

          * Since it is a new technology, finding relevant experienced people in
          this domain will be difficult. 

          * It is easy to get mobile app developers but designers for augmented
          reality would be a tough task. 

          * There are only a few machine learning experts in the market now.

          * This service needs a lot of believe and patients as it is a new
          venture. Finding people with similar beliefs, dedication and
          trustworthy will not be an easy task. Every individual will have
          different thoughts and goals.
